# Visual Display (Optional)

When we talk about a visual display we talk about giving you the understand of what is happening in the simulator running in the cloud. 

The best example is the manual control of the simulator in the cloud. 

* Note that this is a feature of the service that will be enhanced with a more streamlined experience soon.

For a visual display of the could simulator, you will need a local X11 installation. 

Our current visualization relies on X11 and is available on Linux out of the box. 

Mac is not officially supported, but if you need help, contact us and we can walk you through it. Windows does not support X11.

Our next release will have visualizations back in the browser (as our previous release did), but with added support for visuals from any/multiple sensors.
